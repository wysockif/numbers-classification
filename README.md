### About

This project was created during the third semester of studying Computer Science.

The problem was relalated to machine-learning and was about recognizing what number is in the photo with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database">MNIST database</a>.

We used TensorFlow, modified already done solution: https://pythonprogramming.net/introduction-deep-learning-python-tensorflow-keras/. We investigated different parametres and then we checked how results of our neuron network changed.

Project duration time: 13 Jan 2021 - 31 Jan 2021
